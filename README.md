# World Map Predictive Analysis

Our project, World Map Predictive Analysis, is a metric (GDP, population, etc) predictor for any given country for any given year. We plan on
building a machine learning algorithm that can generate future yearly metrics using training data from
1956 - 2017. Our chosen metrics will be weighted into one easy to understand coefficient which
will be used as a "heatmap" on our interactive website. We also plan to display this data for all countries in a GUI (website?) that is also interactive. Users will have the ability to manipulate the weights of the
metrics they value more (ex. high population is important, thus more weight). The GUI will
display the according coefficient depending on the inputted weights of the user, along with the specific predicted data for that year.
The program will have two components: the machine learning aspect and the GUI/website aspect.
The machine learning model will be responsible for using prior data to generate future data. The
GUI will be responsible for displaying the outputs. The interactive user interface make changes
to the model, which will then change the displayed metrics.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

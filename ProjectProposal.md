# Project Proposal 

The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?
	
Using a Kaggle dataset of the "happiness" scores for each country, along with several other associated metrics, we will create a program that can predict the coefficient of disparity (GINI Coefficient) between rich and poor based on the entry of other metrics for a given country. We will explore the topic of machine learning at a base level by training a dataset. The minimum viable product will be software that can be trained by the Kaggle dataset below to then generate a GINI score for a country based on other metrics being inputted. The database we are using will need to have the GINI scores added.

Learning Goals: What are your individual learning goals for this project?

Sampei: 
Basics of Machine Learning
Structure of datasets

Sara: 
Working with large datasets

Both: 
Using Git more effectively 
Working with classes 


Implementation Plan: 

We plan to use a Kaggle dataset along with our research for additional metrics to add to the dataset. We plan to figure out what the basics of machine learning are as they relate to this project, then to make sure our dataset is complete by adding the GINI coefficients for the training set (about 80% of the data on Kaggle), then we plan to identify and work with a ML library that can help us optimize our model. Then, using that trained library, we will identify GINI coefficients based on inputted country metrics and compare these to existing metrics (the remaining 20% of the Kaggle data) for validation.
 
Project schedule: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.

Collaboration plan: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.

Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project? Since youâ€™ve identified them, how will you mitigate them?


Additional Course Content: What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?

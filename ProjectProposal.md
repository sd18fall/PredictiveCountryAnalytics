# Project Proposal 

The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?
	
Using a Kaggle dataset of the "happiness" scores for each country, along with several other associated metrics, we will create a program that can predict the coefficient of disparity (GINI Coefficient) between rich and poor based on the entry of other metrics for a given country. We will explore the topic of machine learning at a base level by training a dataset. The minimum viable product will be software that can be trained by the Kaggle dataset below to then generate a GINI score for a country based on other metrics being inputted. The database we are using will need to have the GINI scores added.

Learning Goals: What are your individual learning goals for this project?

Sampei: 
Basics of Machine Learning
Structure of datasets

Sara: 
Working with large datasets

Both: 
Using Git more effectively 
Working with classes 


Implementation Plan: 

We plan to use a Kaggle dataset along with our research for additional metrics to add to the dataset. We plan to figure out what the basics of machine learning are as they relate to this project, then to make sure our dataset is complete by adding the GINI coefficients for the training set (about 80% of the data on Kaggle), then we plan to identify and work with a ML library that can help us optimize our model. Then, using that trained library, we will identify GINI coefficients based on inputted country metrics and compare these to existing metrics (the remaining 20% of the Kaggle data) for validation.
 
Project schedule: 
Week 1: Learn basics of machine learning and how they are implemented with datasets
Week 2 - 4: Building machine learning algorithm to predict GINI coefficients
Week 5 - 6: Optimize and make the learning algorithm more accurate (vary metrics, vary ML model, etc)

Collaboration plan: 
Weekly meetings: Wednesday 8 - 10 pm; Sunday 7 - 9 PM with option to resume after 10 PM if needed
Work will be done largely in meetings together. Work will be split into individual tasks that are performed alongside each other. These twice-weekly meetings and twice-weekly classes will serve as stand-ups (as well as work time when given in class and fully at meetings). 


Risks: 
Difficulty obtaining metrics/Not enough data
Machine learning is a new subject for both of us 


Additional Course Content: 
Basics of supervised machine learning - particularly the models/fitting equations
Working with databases
